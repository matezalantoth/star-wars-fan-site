A little project where you can favourite star wars films and characters, and then read about their details in the profile page.\
Requirements:\
MongoDB Server\
Recaptcha Secret Key for localhost

## Startup
Once you have cloned the repo, run npm i in both backend and frontend directories.\
Then make sure to add a .env to both the backend and frontend directories. \
The backend .env will need to have a database connection URI and a port, it should look somehting like this:\
\
`URI="{mongodb connection string}"`\
`PORT=3000`\
\
make sure to change the vite.config.js proxy `/api` to the port you entered into the backend .env.\
The frontend .env needs to contain your reCaptcha key\
\
`VITE_APP_SITE_KEY={recaptchakey}
`\
\
Now it should be ready to run the populate.\
start up the backend with `npm run dev` and open up a terminal to \
curl or some form of querying software.\
Run this curl to populate the database: `curl -X POST http://localhost:{port}/api/setter`\
\
Once done, it is now ready to use! Enjoy!
